# Log

like a real scientist I'll log most of the things I do for future reference.

## 2020-8-3

Start day of Project CIO.

### 20:01

I created a simple Rust program that'll initialize the 'DATACORE'. I am not that good at Rust, so most of the programs I write in it are going to be small.

### 20:25

I made the license and log and all and started making this repository a happy place for my code.

### 20:32

Uploaded it to GitHub on Private.

Also started doubting  if this project should remain private.

### 20:39

Just thought about how this file could become very big, I am going to transfer the log out of README.MD and into a separate PROJECT-LOG.MD :)

### 22:22

Added more meta-info in the repo of cio-datacore-init. Also recompiled and readded it to the main repo.
