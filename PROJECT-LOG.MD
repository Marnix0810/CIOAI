# Log

like a real scientist I'll log most of the things I do for future reference.

Start day of Project CIO.

### 20:01

I created a simple Rust program that'll initialize the 'DATACORE'. I am not that good at Rust, so most of the programs I write in it are going to be small.

### 20:25

I made the license and log and all and started making this repository a happy place for my code.

### 20:32

Uploaded it to GitHub on Private.

Also started doubting  if this project should remain private.

### 20:39

Just thought about how this file could become very big, I am going to transfer the log out of README.MD and into a separate PROJECT-LOG.MD :)

### 22:22

Added more meta-info in the repo of cio-datacore-init. Also recompiled and re-added it to the main repo.

I just added a table of contents to readme.md I couldn't just use the Typora TOC because it doesn't work with GitHub, so I manually made one.

Just came to think about it... The most of the programming of this project will take place while using it, but it won't learn for now or in any near future at least until it is far enough to function on its own (if ever) so it might be better to just call it a digital assistant since it is no AI yet.

Also, I need to make this project public. And maybe the log on Twitter or something?
