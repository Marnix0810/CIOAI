An AI-assistant like the movies have. Well, if I manage to create it.

## License

The project is licensed under a edited version of my own license ([The 0810 simple and permissive license](https://github.com/Marnix0810/0810-SPL) (rev. [1.2](https://github.com/Marnix0810/0810-SPL/blob/master/latest-1.2/0810-SPL1.2.md))), but it's a private project, so I don't think anyone will ever open it, but if you read this, I probably did ;).

### [License.md](./License.md):
